** Meeting Discussion: **
- Jose presented his initial approaches to mimic the examples from CARBayes's vignette 
- Steven went through the code and re-organize the GitHub repository. 

** To do list for this week:**
- Run Steven's codes and go through the comments on `Disease_Mapping_US_COVID.R`.
- Things to do listed in the R script: 
  1. A function to allow user to specify which week or which month or any arbitrary window of date
  2. HighlightOption: I want to highlight a county when the mouse hovers over it so I used the highlightOptions. But the border stays on even after mouse out. Can you fix it?
  3. Focus on 48 states?
