**Questions:**
1. What is the plan for the state plots? Will we load a second 'map0' leaflet outside of the server function?
2. In terms of animation, are we expecting to create an application similar to the on you discussed in the email(1)? Or are we still trying to replicate SpatialEpiApp? 
3. How are we formatting other data, such as deaths, into the compiled dataset since they all share the same column name? 
4. Alternative to setShapeStyle() could be to have a "hover" option to display stats rather than clicking. (use label option instead of popup)
