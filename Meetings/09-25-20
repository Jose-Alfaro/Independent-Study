** Meeting Discussion: **
- I presented my progress so far which included: the date specification function that allows users to specify a time period to view the data, an update
to the dataset (removed Alaska and Hawaii), and some updates to the leaflet plot such as the addition of the county hightlight and the descriptive data 
pop-ups. Lastly, I presented my simple rendition of our shiny app.

** To do list for this week:**
1. Add an action button to the shiny app to prevent unnecessary loading times.
2. Create state vs. county plot.
3. Adjust by population.
4. Implement CARBayes model from example 3.
