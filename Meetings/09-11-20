** Meeting Discussion: **
In today's meeting we discussed the CARBayes vignette as well as the SpatialEpi Paper. In this discussion, we pointed out some of the utilities that the application 
has and noted some improvements that we could implement into our version of it. For instance, we could allow users to specify location on a state level and plot
a moving visual of the entire United States below the state plot using GGAnimate to save on load time. Additionally, we pointed out some of the flaws that were
found in the Johns Hopkins dataset. Specifically, its 98 observations with (0, 0) coordinates and its lack of data for Wyoming and Wisconsin. From this, we cross 
referenced a list of counites in the United States and saw that Wisconsin and Wyoming are composed of 94 counties total. Thus, this raises the question: are the 
observations with coordinate values (0, 0) suppose to correspond to the missing states? We will do our research to confirm this and find a second dataset for these 
states to merge with our current dataset to form a complete dataset. Furthermore, we went ahead and cleaned the dataset so that it is composed of only the 50 
continental states and thus excluding territories and cruise lines from the dataset. From this cleaned dataset, two subsets were created that contained weekly and
monthly counts (aggregated the data). Lastly, we discussed the possibility of adding a "non-traditional" variable into our model that is composed of sentiment scores 
based off of Twitter tweets by state.

** To do list for this week:**
- Upload R script onto github
- Find missing values for Wyoming and Wisconsin (create a complete dataset)
- Replicate Examples from the CARBayes vignette using our data
- Create plots using shape files
