Today we extended our discussion over COVID related topics such as predicting COVID 19 trends using internet data and disease mapping.
More specifically, we found that the repository provided by Johns Hopkins University (1) contained both state and county level information on confirmed cases.
We saw that the dataset provided contained both latitude and longitude columns that would allow us to plot this information on a map of the US potentially 
through the use of as Shiny application. While searching for this repository, we also found a second dataset provided by the NYTimes (2) that offered both 
state and county wide confirmed cases in separate files. However, this dataset did not contain any coordinates for the proposed counties.

** Discussion about disease mapping: **
If we decide to implement disease mapping methodology to the COVID-19 data provided by Johns Hopkins University, we would implement those techniques outlined in
the CARBayes vignette. It was decided that our response variable in this case would be the number of confirmed cases (counts) with potential covariates such as 
population in each county or states. The main goal for this upcoming week is to finish reading the CARBayes vignette in order to gain a better understanding of 
the methodology that is being implemented. 
We also discussed the possibility of creating an R Shiny application that showcases the "hot spots" in the United States at a county level. As a reference, we will 
be viewing Paula Moraga's Shiny application (3) and reading over her publication to gain a better understanding of how it works.

** To do list for this week:**
- Finish reading CARBayes Vignette 
- Read Paula Moraga's SpatialEpi paper (over the Shiny application)
- Convert CSV file into a data frame containing longitude, latitude, and counts
- Look into ggplot's axis break issue. Is this currently doable or do we have to make an extension? Are there any other improvements that can be done?
