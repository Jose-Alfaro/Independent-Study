1. After merging the 'pop' dataset and the 'death' dataset together, I realized that the death dataset had a "Population" column that the original county dataset did not have.
Because of this, I will be removing the external csv file containing the estimated county populations. After comparing the county population estimates from the csv file to those
in the deaths dataset, I saw that the numbers were identical. Thus, it seems that the deaths dataset also used the 2019 population projections from the US census.
