** Questions: **
1. What predictors should we include in the model? So far, the only two predictors I have included in our model are county population and death counts. We have discussed adding 
non-linear predictors into the model such as a tweet sentiment analysis, but for now lets focus on predictors that we can grasp relatively quickly. I am considering adding a predictor
with 2 factors which classifies each county as republican or democratic, what do you think? I would also like to add a predictor that accounts for the number of COVID tests a 
county has taken, but this data seems to be very hard to find. I believe the CDC has something like this, but at the state and country level. We could also add a predictor for
the number of recovered cases in each county, but again, this data seems to be a bit hard to find. 

** Meeting Discussion: **
1. After merging the 'pop' dataset and the 'death' dataset together, I realized that the death dataset had a "Population" column that the original county dataset did not have.
Because of this, I will be removing the external csv file containing the estimated county populations. After comparing the county population estimates from the csv file to those
in the deaths dataset, I saw that the numbers were identical. Thus, it seems that the deaths dataset also used the 2019 population projections from the US census.
