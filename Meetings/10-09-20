** Questions: **
1. What predictors should we include in the model? So far, the only two predictors I have included in our model are county population and death counts. We have discussed adding 
non-linear predictors into the model such as a tweet sentiment analysis, but for now lets focus on predictors that we can grasp relatively quickly. I am considering adding a predictor
with 2 factors which classifies each county as republican or democratic, what do you think? I would also like to add a predictor that accounts for the number of COVID tests a 
county has taken, but this data seems to be very hard to find. I believe the CDC has something like this, but at the state and country level. We could also add a predictor for
the number of recovered cases in each county, but again, this data seems to be a bit hard to find. Possibly income data?
2. Is it normal for spatial data to have a strong pattern in the residuals? To me, the answer clearly indicates to yes, but in the example in the vignette both the QQ plot and the
residuals plot seemed to have improved drastically after taking the natural log transformation. This, however, could simply be an artifact of the dataset used. 
3. Consider calculating SIR (standardized incidence ratio) or SMR (Standardized Mortality Ratio) and using this as out predictor. This is the ratio of the observed over expected counts.

** Notes: **
1. I have temporarily commented out the removal of the county population column from our dataset so that we can include it as a predictor.
2. When fitting the linear model Count_Sum = Population + Death_Sum, I noticed that the QQ plot was clearly not normal. Also, the residuals were heteroskedastic. However, when I fit the 
linear model log(Count_Sum + 1) = Population + Death_Sum, the QQ-Plot drastically improved, but the residuals plot seemed to get worse. In the residual plot, the variance was smaller, 
but there was clearly a strong trend. Nonetheless, I proceeded modeling with the log transformed data. Both of the predictors were significant at the alpha < 0.0001 level. 
3. There are three counties with no neighbors. This will cause problems when determining spatial autocorrelations and modeling. I have temporarily removed them. The counties are:
FIPS:    County:
25007    Dukes, MA
25019    Nantucket, MA
53055    San Juan, WA

4. Data tested positive for spatial correlation using Moran's I statistic (p-val = 0.000999).
5. I have added a dataset that has the median household income by county for 2018.

** Meeting Discussion: **
1. After merging the 'pop' dataset and the 'death' dataset together, I realized that the death dataset had a "Population" column that the original county dataset did not have.
Because of this, I will be removing the external csv file containing the estimated county populations. After comparing the county population estimates from the csv file to those
in the deaths dataset, I saw that the numbers were identical. Thus, it seems that the deaths dataset also used the 2019 population projections from the US census.
